## [1.1.0] - 2024-05-06

### Added
- Ability to create TransactionInputs from a utxo, creating a partial sourceTransaction. 
Use is like so:
```javascript
const input = fromUtxo({
    txid: '434555433eaca96dff6e71a4d02febd0dd3832e5ca4e5734623ca914522e17d5',
    vout: 0,
    script: '76a914d01b0b702ee90e00944342f97c772a8be83e42a288ac',
    satoshis: 1234
}, new P2PKH().unlock(key))

tx.addInput(input)
```
- Ability to create a transaction from Extended Format bytes or hex. The result being a partial sourceTransaction in each input.
```javascript
const tx = Transaction.fromHexEF('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')
