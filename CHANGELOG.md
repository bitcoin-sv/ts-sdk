## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

### Security

---

## [1.6.8] - 2025-06-26

### Change

- VarInt read and write methods will now handle negative numbers by writing them as Int64.
- `readVarIntNum` method now takes a signed argument to control whether to read as Int64 or Uint64.

### Added

- OverflowInt64 and OverflowUint64 constants.
- `readInt64LEBn` method to read Int64 values.

---

## [1.6.7] - 2025-06-25

### Change

To LocalKVStore:

- Extend locks to lockQueues and to get and remove operations.

---

## [1.6.6] - 2025-06-25

### Change

To LocalKVStore:

- Make the `set` method update each key value atomically.
- Add acceptDelayedBroadcast constructor argument, default false.

---

## [1.6.5] - 2025-06-21

### Added
- ChainTracker which relies on an instance of [Block Headers Service](https://github.com/bitcoin-sv/block-headers-service).

---

## [1.6.4] - 2025-06-20

### Change
- Export the type for `ScriptChunk` properly.

---

## [1.6.3] - 2025-06-20

### Change
- `SimplifiedFetchTransport`: Added more checks to ensure the connection at the transport layer is correct when sending certificates.

---

## [1.6.2] - 2025-06-18

### Change

- Use `OffChainValues` with TopicBroadcaster from `tx.metadata`
- Handle and return context explicitly in LookupResolver

---

## [1.6.1] - 2025-06-16

### Change

- New types for Private Overlay support

---

## [1.6.0] - 2025-05-29

### Fixed

- Align eval mem limits with current miner policy while stopping memory attacks at 100MB
- Use BigInt in BigNumber for faster performance
- Optimize script interpreter memory usage

## [1.5.3] - 2025-05-29

### Change

- Make verifyValid in Beef class public. It was private.

---

## [1.5.1] - 2025-05-13

### Fixed

- Stop parsing script chunks once we hit an op return out of a conditional block.

---

## [1.5.0] - 2025-05-09

### Added

- ReactNativeWebView substrate, intentionally keeping the JSON stringify simple option for seralization, not using base64 so that we can update JSON HTTP at the same time as ReactNativeWebView. Therefore NOT for production use yet. I'm keen to get this in here so that updating deps within apps will allow us to test many apps from within mobile context in these early days.

---

## [1.4.24] - 2025-05-01

### Added

- A binary body http client and Teranode HTTP broadcaster.

---

## [1.4.22] - 2025-04-27

### Added

- A helper function to create a VerifiableCertificate from a WalletCertificate for ease of use

---

## [1.4.22] - 2025-04-27

### Added

- Max Memory Allocation for script evaluation defaulting to 100 KB for practicality (concensus policy is 100 MB but this would kill a regular browser window for example, so users who want to do things like OP_PUSHTX with a massive ordinal in the input should explicitly set a higher limit as so:

```js
tx.verify('scripts only', new SatoshisPerKilobyte(1), 100000000)
```

Developers are encouraged to have this set to something pretty low if their app is just for P2PKH for example where allocation can be more like 35 bytes. That would prevent malicious actors sending high memory use transactions as an attack on the service.

### Changed

There was some slightly weird patterns in the Spend step method which. It was async, I think unnecessarily. It was also looping beyond the point of script execution failure. Noticable now that it will fail on exceeding the allowed memory allocation.

---

## [1.4.21] - 2025-04-17

---

## [1.3.8] - 2025-01-20

---

## [1.2.22] - 2025-01-06

### Fixed

- #158

## [1.2.18] - 2024-12-19

### Added

- Enumerated constants for the tx data type in beef encoded transaction lists.

### Removed

- Removed the idea of "V1" and "V2" beef. There is already a version number which is encoded in the bytes, I think it's clearer if we stick to one.
- Removed the V1 capability to use txidOnly.

### Fixed

- There was a slice of the BeefTxs array in Beef which should be a splice (remove a tx) 

### Changed

- Refactored a bunch of functions on advice from Sonar Qube which suggested they were a little to dense for most people to follow.
- Refactored for loops into for-of loops where possible.
- Refactored loops where the loop counter is updated within the loop which is advised against.

### Added
- fromCoinbaseTxidAndHeight method to the MerklePath class for that special case
- added test demonstrating how to validate scripts only for one tx even when you don't have a merkle path for the previous tx.
  ```js
  // merklePath just has to be set to any object.
  sourceTransaction.merklePath = { assumeValid: true }
  tx.inputs[0].sourceTransaction = sourceTransaction
  await tx.verify('scripts only')
  ```
